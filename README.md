# advent-of-code
- This repository contains my solutions for "Advent of Code" challenges (http://adventofcode.com).
- I am using AoC as a chance to get familiar with Python, for me a completely new (and exciting!) language, so you might find some cringeworthy Python beginner code. If you do, or if you have any other comments/suggestions regarding my solutions, feel free to express them. I would highly appreciate any constructive criticism.  
- My primary goal is to persist in this quest through the unknown and finish all 25 challenges in a language I've never used before, without ever fleeing to a warm, familiar place called C++.
- Many thanks to Google, my faithful companion and a true master of Python, to whom I owe a great deal.
- You're allowed to look around, steal codes, copy solutions and cast black magic.
